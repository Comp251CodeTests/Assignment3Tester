# Assignment 3  Tester
## Don't share any of your code

### DISCLAIMER: 
This tester adds import java.io.FileNotFoundException in the 3 classes that are to be submitted.
Be sure to remove them before submitting your final work on codePost.

To run the tests you only have to run the main method of Ass3Tester.java. If your Q1, Q2 and Q3 folders are not inside
a A3 folder you will get a fileNotFound exception. To fix this either move your 3 "Q" folders inside an A3 folder or change
the file paths used (from "A3//Q1//..." to "Q1//..." for example).


Make sure that when you commit to this repo you don't include any of your code or solutions.

If your tester code has something that is not straight forward or needs more explaining feel free to add it here or in the code comments.
If you can avoid creating a new file for your specific tester (unless you are the first to post it) it would be great so that we have a single file for all tests. And make sure when adding a test that it is not already there.
